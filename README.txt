EMPRESS—Extensible Metadata PRovider for Extreme-scale Scientific Simulations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

sqlite3.{hc} are generated from the public domain SQLite project.

EMPRESS provides custom metadata services for scientific simulations. It can hold arbitrary data types for user specified tags at runtime. It can associate the tag with a portion of a variable, a timestep, or an entire run.

The system is discussed in detail in the PDSW-DISCS @ SC17 and SC18 papers as well as in Margaret Lawson's thesis available from Dartmouth as a tech report (TR2018-846):
